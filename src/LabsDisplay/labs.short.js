      Eval: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.
